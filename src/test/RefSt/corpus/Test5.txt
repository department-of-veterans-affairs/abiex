Doppler waveforms are monophasic at all levels from the femoral
to the dorsalis pedis artery. The ankle brachial index is 0.82
on the right and 1.1 on the left. Pulse volume recordings on the
right show mild drop-off at the thigh compared to the opposite
thigh, continued drop-off at the calf and metatarsal. On the
left, PVRs are relatively maintained to the calf level and show
significant drop-off at the ankle and metatarsals.
