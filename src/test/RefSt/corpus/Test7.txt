Doppler evaluation was performed of both lower extremity
arterial systems at rest. On the right, Doppler tracings are
triphasic at the femoral, popliteal and dorsalis pedis. They are
absent at the posterior tibial. Ankle brachial index is 1.08.
Pulse volume recordings are mildly decreased at the ankle and
metatarsal. Left Doppler tracings are triphasic at the femoral,
popliteal, and posterior tibial levels. They are monophasic at
the dorsalis pedis.  Ankle brachial index is 0.94. Pulse volume
recordings show mild drop off at the ankle and metatarsal.
IMPRESSION: Mild bilateral tibial artery occlusive disease.
